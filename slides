# Scooter Demand Forecasting API - Project Summary

---

## Slide 1: Key Findings

- **Accurate Demand Predictions**
  - Achieved high accuracy with RMSE, MAE, and low MAPE.
  - Reliable forecasting facilitates optimal scooter distribution.

- **Effective Feature Engineering**
  - Integration of temporal (e.g., day of the week) and weather-related features enhances model performance.
  - Demand lag features provide valuable historical context.

- **Robust Model Performance**
  - Consistent results across different evaluation metrics.
  - Model effectively captures demand patterns and seasonal trends.

## Slide 2: Evaluation Metrics and Reasoning

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **Purpose:** Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.
  - **Reasoning:** Emphasizes larger errors, ensuring the model minimizes significant prediction deviations.

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Purpose:** Calculates the average absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
  - **Reasoning:** Provides a clear interpretation of average error in original units, offering straightforward performance insight.

- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
  - **Purpose:** Computes the average absolute percentage differences between predicted and actual values.
  - **Reasoning:** Offers a relative error measure, facilitating performance comparison across different scales and contexts.

- **Combined Insight:**
  - Utilizing RMSE, MAE, and MAPE ensures a comprehensive evaluation, balancing sensitivity to large errors with overall prediction accuracy.

## Slide 3: Next Steps and Productionizing the Model

- **Model Refinement**
  - **Simplify Feature Set:** Remove less impactful features (e.g., `demand_lag_1`) to streamline real-time predictions.
  - **Enhance Feature Engineering:** Incorporate additional indicators like holidays, special events, and granular weather data.

- **Deployment Strategy**
  - **Containerization with Docker:** Ensure consistent deployment environments across different platforms.
  - **Orchestration with Kubernetes:** Achieve scalable and resilient deployment, handling varying traffic loads efficiently.

- **Monitoring and Maintenance**
  - **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement logging and alerting systems using Prometheus and Grafana to track API usage and model performance.
  - **Automated Retraining:** Set up pipelines for periodic model retraining with new data to maintain accuracy over time.

- **Security Enhancements**
  - **Authentication and Authorization:** Protect API endpoints using API keys or OAuth to restrict access to authorized users.
  - **Input Validation:** Ensure all incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent malicious inputs from affecting predictions.
